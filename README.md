# Typed

*Typed* is a *low-dependencies*, *concise*, *batteries included* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) library for **advanced functional programming** using tools from [Type Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), [Category Theory](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf) and **Logic**.

- *low-dependencies*: it depends only on *Scala/ScalaJS* standard libraries.
- *concise*: it provides a simple, synthetic and small [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) instead of implementing all the 42289 variations possible of each concepts.
- *batteries included*: it comes in only one flavor which contains everything, ready to use. 

Unlike most Category-theory based libraries, such as [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/), [ScalaZ 7](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) and [GHC Base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base), whose implementation are specialized towards a unique category, *Typed* aims to be as flexible as possible.

**Typed is in very early stage of development! Do not use it in production!**
